Hello,

I'm Daisy, a research scientist pursuing machine learning applications in space for scientific insight.

* I have developed a multi input model combining deep leaning and random forest methods to automatically identify magnetospheric regions.
* I am working on a large language model development using supervised fine-tuning. I am excited about the use of machine leaning for understanding space physics.
