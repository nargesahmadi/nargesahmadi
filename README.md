Hello,

I'm Daisy, a computational research scientist pursuing machine learning applications in space for scientific insight.

* Developed a multi input model combining deep leaning and random forest methods to automatically identify magnetospheric regions.
* Working on large scale HPC simulations to understand the space environment around Earth and help predicting space weather.
* Working on a large language model development using supervised fine-tuning to upskill my machine learning knowledge.
* Looking for collaboration on machine learning applications in space technology.
